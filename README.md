The implementation of The Haskell School Of Music book and some developments i have made

Please check the book for more information about how to create algorithmic music and also for signal processing and production. Haskell gives a lot when it comes to music i believe. For signals, an open source project baudline is already on files. You can analyze your sound signals visually with it.
